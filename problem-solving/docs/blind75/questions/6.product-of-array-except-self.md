## Problem statement
<details open>
   <summary>Read statemenet</summary>

Given an integer array $nums$, return an array $answer$ such that $answer[i]$ is equal to the product of all the elements of $nums$ except $nums[i]$.

The product of any prefix or suffix of $nums$ is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in $O(n)$ time and without using the division operation.

 

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
``` 

Constraints:

- ```2 <= nums.length <= 105```
- ```-30 <= nums[i] <= 30```


The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
 

Follow up: Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

## Review Notes

### #1  Brute force approach

A Brute force appraoch would be iterating through the array and computing the product of all the elements, and then dividing that number by the current element. this might work for some inputs, but for some inputs $0$ it will throw an arithmetic exception, since dividing any number by zero gives the answer “equal to infinity.”.

### #2 Left and Right product lists

- Iterate through and build a new array that holds product of everything on the left for each item
- Do the same on a new array for everything on the right
- For answer, simply, multiply left[i] and right[i]

- **Time complexity**: $O(n)$ 


- **Space Complexity**: $O(n)$ 


---

### #3 O(1) space complexity approach without conting the answer array
to optimize is to not create left and right, and answer arrays, but use the answer array as a placeholder for the left products, and use a vairbale to hold the product of everything on the right, and then multiply the right product by the answer's current element.

  
- **Time complexity**: $O(n)$ 

- **Space**: $O(1)$  if we didn't concider counting the answer array
