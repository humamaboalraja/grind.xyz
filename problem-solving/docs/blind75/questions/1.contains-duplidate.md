## Problem statement
<details open>
   <summary>Read statemenet</summary>

Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.

**Example 1:**
```bash
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true
```

Example 2:
```bash
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**
```bash
Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true
```

Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 105
- 109 <= nums[i] <= 109

## New Concepts

1. **Loop invariant**
   - "It is hard to keep track of what is happening with loops. Loops which don't terminate or terminate without achieving their goal behavior is a common problem in computer programming. Loop invariants help. A loop invariant is a formal statement about the relationship between variables in your program which holds true just before the loop is ever run (establishing the invariant) and is true again at the bottom of the loop, each time through the loop (maintaining the invariant)." <small><a href="#">Source [cs.miami.edu]</a></small>

2. **Naive algorithm**
   - A Naive algorithm is usually the most obvious solution when one is asked a problem. It may not be a smart algorithm but will probably get the job done. <small><a href="#">Source [stackoverflow.com]</a></small>

## Review Notes

### #1 Naive Linear Search

- **Time complexity**: $O(n^2)$ 
- **Space**: $O(1)$ 


### #2 Sorting the input array

Duplicate numbers will be consecutive after sorting.

- **Time complexity**: $O(n \ logn)$ 
- **Space**: $O(1)$ 

This approach modifies the original input array by sorting it, which is not a good practice, unless it's clear that the input will be modified. 
instead we can make a copy of `nums` and operate on the copy.



### #3 Using Hash Table

We use a dynamic data structure that supports fast/constant search and insert operations.

- **Time complexity**: $O(n)$ 
- **Space**: $O(n)$
