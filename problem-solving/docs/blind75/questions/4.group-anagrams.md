## Problem statement
<details open>
   <summary>Read statemenet</summary>

Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: strs = [""]
Output: [[""]]
```

Example 3:
```
Input: strs = ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]
```



**Constraints**:

- `1 <= strs.length <= 104`
- `0 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
- `strs[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

## New Concepts/ Tools
1. String are immutable in Java, so we need to use char array to store the string. then operate on it and convert it back to a string.
2. HashMap.containsKey() Returns true if this map contains a mapping for the specified key. O(1)
3. `map[listKey] = newValue` add new values to a list that is contained as a value in a map
4. `val charArrayString = String(str)` converts a char array string to a string.
5. `mutableListOf(1,..,3).addAll(...)` Appends all the elements in the specified collection to the end of this list, in the order that they are returned by the specified collection's iterator.

> The trick about understanding this problem is that all words will be processed and if they exist as a key they will be added to that key's value list because they're anagrams. otherwise, they will be added to a new key.

## Review Notes

### #1 Categorize by Sorted String . 1st approach

if and only if the sorted strings of two strings are equal, they are anagrams.

Maintain a map `groupedAnagrams` : `{String -> List}` where each key $keyAnagram$ is a sorted string, and each value is the list of strings from the initial input that when sorted, are equal to $keyAnagram$.

If our input is:
strs = ["eat","ate","tea","eta","post","pots","spot","stop","tops"]

Our hashmap structure over iterations would be:

```bash
{=[eat]}
{=[eat, ate]}
{=[eat, ate, tea]}
{=[eat, ate, tea, eta]}
{=[eat, ate, tea, eta], =[post]}
{=[eat, ate, tea, eta], =[post, pots]}
{=[eat, ate, tea, eta], =[post, pots, spot]}
{=[eat, ate, tea, eta], =[post, pots, spot, stop]}
{=[eat, ate, tea, eta], =[post, pots, spot, stop, tops]}
[[eat, ate, tea, eta], [post, pots, spot, stop, tops]]
```

<br>

- **Time complexity**: $O(N K log K)$ 
  - $N$ is the length of `strs`, and $K$ is the maximum length of a string in `strs`.

- **Space**: $O(NK)$ 
  - Space Complexity: O(NK), the total information content stored in `computedAnagrams`.

### #2 Categorize by Count . 2nd approach

Based on that: Two strings are anagrams if and only if their character counts (respective number of occurrences of each character) are the same.

We can transform each string $arrayAnagramElement$ into a character count, $strCounterCharArray$, consisting of 26 non-negative integers representing the number of a's, b's,  c's, etc. We use these counts as the basis for our hash map.


- **Time complexity**: $O(NK)$ 
  - $N$ is the length of `strs`, and $K$ is the maximum length of a string in `strs`. Counting each string is linear in the size of the string, and we count every string.


- **Space**: $O(NK)$ 
  - Space Complexity: O(NK), the total information content stored in `computedAnagrams`.
