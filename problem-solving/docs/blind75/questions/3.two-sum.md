## Problem statement
<details open>
   <summary>Read statemenet</summary>

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

P.s we're gauranteed that theres exactly one solution so we don't hav to worry about mutliple solution or not finding a solution.

 

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```

Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
``` 

Constraints:

- 2 <= nums.length <= 104
- 109 <= nums[i] <= 109
- 109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.
 

Follow-up: Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n2) time complexity?


**Constraints**:

- 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 104
- s and t consist of lowercase English letters.
 

Follow up: What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such a case?

## New Concepts/ Tools
1. Often if algorithm's time complexity is $O(n^2)$ and $O(1)$ space complexity, we can improve that to have the time being $O(n)$ and the space being $O(n)$, by using a hash table to speed up the algorithm.
2. The reason we mostly care about time more than space, because we can easily increase the memory size, but we can never buy more time.
3. The best way to maintain a mapping of each element in the array to its index is a hash table, because using Hashtable Lookup time can be reduced from $O(n)$ to $O(1)$ by trading space for speed. 
4. Lookups in Hashtables happen in constant amortized time, but if a collision happened, a lookup could worsen to $O(n)$ time.
5. HashMap stores key, value pairs and it does not allow duplicate keys, If the key is duplicate then the old key is replaced with the new value.
6. HashMap allows one null key and multiple null values.
7. HashMap does not maintain any order.
8. `Map<Generic, Generic> map = new HashMap<>();` defining a map with generic keys and generic values.
9. `map.put(i, nums[i])` Associates the specified value with the specified key in this map (optional operation). If the map previously contained a mapping for the key, the old value is replaced by the specified value. $O(1)$ time complexity.
10. `map.containsKey(i)` Returns true if this map contains a mapping for the specified key. $O(1)$ time complexity.
11. `map.get(i)` Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or null if this map contains no mapping for the key. $O(1)$ time complexity.

## Review Notes


### #1. Brute Force

<details>

<summary>Approach 1:  </summary>

</details>



We Loop through each element `i` and find if there is another value that equals to $target − i$.

**Complexity Analysis**

Time complexity: $O(n^2)$. For each element in `nums`, we try to find its complement by looping through the rest of the array which takes $O(n)$ time. Therefore, the time complexity is $O(n^2)$.

Space complexity: $O(1)$. Because no space depends on the size of the input array `nums`, and only constant space is being utilized.

#### Approach 2:
We Loop through each element `i` and check every combination of two valeus in `nums` and see if they sum up to our target by adding them together.

**Complexity Analysis**

Time complexity: $O(n^2)$. For each element in `nums`, we try to add it to the rest of the items in the array and check if each combiniation sum up to target by looping through the rest of the array which takes $O(n)$ time. Therefore, the time complexity is $O(n^2)$.

Space complexity: $O(1)$.


### #2 Using a hash table

While we are iterating and inserting elements into the hash table, we also look back to check if current element's complement $(target - nums[i])$ already exists in the hash table. If it exists, we return current element's index and its complement's index which means that we have found a solution and return the indices immediately.

- **Time complexity**: $O(n)$ 
  - We loop trough the array `nums` that has $n$ elements only once. 
  - Every lookup in the table costs only $O(1)$ amortized time.

- **Space**: $O(n)$ 
  - Because the extra space required depends on the number of items stored in the map, so the complexity is linear
