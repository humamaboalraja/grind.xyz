## Problem statement
<details open>
   <summary>Read statemenet</summary>

Given two strings $s$ and $t$, return true if $t$ is an anagram of $s$, and false otherwise.

> An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

 

Example 1:

```bash
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```

Example 2:
```bash
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```

**Constraints**:

- 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 104
- s and t consist of lowercase English letters.
 

Follow up: What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such a case?

## New Concepts/ Tools

1. **Anagram**
  An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. For example, the word anagram itself can be rearranged into nag a ram, also the word binary into brainy and the word adobe into abode.

## Review Notes

### #1 Sorting

if $s$ is an anagram of $t$, sorting both strings will result in having two identical strings, so if $s$ and $t$ have different lengths, $t$ can't be an anagram of $s$ and we can return false early as our first check.

**String methods and properties**
- ```"string".toCharArray()``` Converts a string to a new character array.
  - Time complexity: $O(n)$ . where $n$ is the number of characters in the string, and because each character must be copied into the array so it's O(n). [Source](https://github.com/nkatre/TimeComplexityOfPredefinedMethodsInJava/blob/master/String%2C%20StringBuilder%20and%20StringBuffer%20class%20methods#:~:text=toCharArray()%20goes%2C%20it's%20O,O(N)%20time%20complexity.)
- ```array1.contentEquals(arr2)``` Returns true if the two specified arrays are structurally equal to one another, i.e. contain the same number of the same elements in the same order.
  - Time complexity: Constant as the length is already known to String instance. [Source](https://stackoverflow.com/a/20264254/15572646)




<br>

- **Time complexity**: $O(nlogn)$ 
  - Sorting takes O(nlogn) time.
  - Comparing the sorted strings takes O(n) time.
  - Sorting time dominates therefore overall time complexity is $O(nlogn)$.

- **Space**: $O(1)$ 
  - If `heapsort` algorithms is used, it takes O(n) space then it takes $O(1)$ auxil$$iary space.
  - Since Java's toCharArray() implementation makes a copy of the string so it costs $O(n)$ extra space, but we ignore this for complexity analysis because it's language dependent detail.


### #2 Counting Frequency

Counting the occurrences of each letter in the two strings and compare them can let us check if $t$ is a rearrangement of $s$, and since $s$ and $t$ only contain english letters from $a$ to $z$ a simple array of size 26 will be enough which will also optimize the space by not utlizizing a dynamic data structure e.g. Hash table.

Follow up: if the inputs contain unicode characters, we can use a hash table instead of a fixed size counter array. Since allocating a large size array to fit the entire range of unicode characters, could go up to more than 1 million. that's why in that case a hash table is a more generic solution and could adapt to any range of characters.

**String methods and properties**
- The equivalent of Javas String.charAt() in Kotlin is `String.get()`. Since this is implemented as an operator, you can use `[index]` instead of `get(index)`. For example [Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50297288/how-can-i-access-a-char-in-string-in-at-specific-number)


**Time and space Complexity**


- **Time complexity**: $O(n)$ for accessing the `counts` table
- **Space**: $O(1)$ for the constant sized used array
