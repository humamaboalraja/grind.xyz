## Problem statement
<details>
   <summary>Read statemenet</summary>

Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
Note:

A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
 



Example 1:

```
Input: board = 
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: true
```

Example 2:

```
Input: board = 
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: false
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.
``` 

Constraints:

- `board.length == 9`
- `board[i].length == 9`
- `board[i][j]` is a digit 1-9 or '.'.

## New Concepts/ Tools

- Integer division: Meaning we will take the integer part only. "Java does integer division, which basically is the same as regular real division, but you throw away the remainder (or fraction). Thus, 7 / 3 is 2 with a remainder of 1. Throw away the remainder, and the result is 2." [source](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~clin/MoreJava/Intro/expr-int-div.html#:~:text=Java%20does%20integer%20division%2C%20which,can%20come%20in%20very%20handy.)
- if w’re dealing with unique values a HashSet is the way to go 
- HashSets are perfect in this case because we can put things to them easily, constant time lookups, and thy only store unique values so theres never gonna be any duplicates.
- The `Java.util.HashSet.add()` method in Java HashSet is used to add a specific element into a HashSet. This method will add the element only if the specified element is not present in the HashSet else the function will return False if the element is already present in the HashSet.

## Review Notes

For each number we want to check if it's unqie in the row, column and sub-box.
1. We go through every single row and mnake sure it doesn't have duplicates
   - We do this using a HashSet, making it easy to check if there are any duplicates
2. For checking each column we can do the exact same thing, having a HashSet for each column.
3. For the last part we can think about dividing the sub-box into 3x3 sub-boxes, since each of these boxes are 3 x 3 square; to do so we can have for example have an index 0 representing the first row of the different square, and index 1 representing the second row of the different square, and so on; and similarly for the columns.

```
          0      1      2
        0,1,2  3,4,5  6,7,8
    0   ◾️ ◾️ ◾️  ◾️ ◾️ ◾️  ◾️ ◾️ ◾️
  0 1   ◾️ ◾️ ◾️  ◾️ ◾️ ◾️  ◾️ ◾️ ◾️
    2   ◾️ ◾️ ◾️  ◾️ ◾️ ◾️  ◾️ ◾️ ◾️
        ———————————————————
    3   ◾️ ◾️ ◾️  ◾️ ◾️ ◾️  ◾️ ◾️ ◾️
  1 4   ◾️ ◾️ ◾️  ◾️ ✹ ◾️  ◾️ ◾️ ◾️
    5   ◾️ ◾️ ◾️  ◾️ ◾️ ◾️  ◾️ ◾️ ◾️
        ———————————————————
    6   ◾️ ◾️ ◾️  ◾️ ◾️ ◾️  ◾️ ◾️ ◾️
  2 7   ◾️ ◾️ ◾️  ◾️ ◾️ ◾️  ◾️ ◾️ ◾️
    8   ◾️ ◾️ ◾️  ◾️ ◾️ ◾️  ◾️ ◾️ ◾️
```
4. Then if we have two indexes, that are e.g. [4, 4], if we can take them and convert it them into 1, 1, then we know that the value is inside this 1, 1 subsqaure the one marked with star :) 
5. so we have 9 different sub-squares that we will have indices to represent them [1,1] means the box that has the star.
6. The math would be since each box is 3 x 3, we can take the actual index e.g. 4 and divide it by 3 (integer divison) 4 / 3, which will give us a 1, and we do the same thign with the column 4 / 3 is 1, so if we take the actual coordinates 4, 4 divide them (integer division by 3) then we get the index for the row column, basically identifies which saure this is a part of.
Examples
7. _ $7 / 3 = 2, 7 / 3 = 2$ - so this means that these indixes belong to this sub-square and this uniuely iditnies that this answer belongs to the [2,2] 3x3 grid.

### #1  Optimal solution

we can iterate over the board and check if each number is unique in the row, column and sub-box.
and to do so we can utilize the `add()` method in the hashSet which returns false in case duplicates were found


- **Time complexity**: $O(9^2)$ -> $O(1)$
Although it consntant because we have to iterate over the whole grid.
If we have an aribtrary grid of size nxn, we will have to iterate over the gridwhole grid. thus the time will be $n^2$
- **Space Complexity**: $O(9^2)$ -> $O(1)$
Extra space we need to create the HashSet for each row, column and sub-box. which will be roughly the size of the grid too. and therefore can be $n^2$

### #2 Using a HashSet

- we can iterate over the board and check if each number is unique in the row, column and sub-box. and to do this we can use a hashset.

- **Time complexity**: $O(n^2)$  -> $O(1)$
in case the board size was $nxn$ we will have to iterate over the whole grid. thus the time will be $n^2$

- **Space Complexity**: $O(n^2)$ -> $O(1)$
Same for the space if we have an aribtrary grid of size nxn, we will have to iterate over the gridwhole grid. thus the time will be $n^2$
