## Problem statement
<details open>
   <summary>Read statemenet</summary>

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
``` 

**Constraints**:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- $k$ is in the range [1, the number of unique elements in the array].
- It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.

 

Follow up: Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than $O(n log n)$, where n is the array's size.

## New Concepts/ Tools

```
Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
Map before anything{1=3, 2=2, 3=1, 9=5, 10=8}

List<Map.Entry<Integer, Integer>> list = new ArrayList<>(map.entrySet());
list after map.entrySet() to ArrayList[1=3, 2=2, 3=1, 9=5, 10=8]

list.sort(Map.Entry.comparingByValue((a, b) -> b - a));
list after sorting[10=8, 9=5, 1=3, 2=2, 3=1]
```

1. ```HashMap<>().getOrDefault()``` Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or defaultValue if this map contains no mapping for the key.
2. ```HashMap<>().keySet()``` Returns a Set view of the keys contained in this map.
3. ``` java.util.Set<Map.Entry<K, V>> entrySet()``` Returns a Set view of the mappings contained in this map.
4. `interface Map.Entry<K, V>` A map entry (key-value pair).
   1. `Map.Entry.comparingByValue()` Returns a comparator that compares Map.Entry by value using the given Comparator.
   2. `getKey()` Returns the key corresponding to this entry.
5. `Interface List<E>`
   1. `get(int index)` Returns the element at the specified position in this list.

6. Min Heaps follow these two properties
  -  Min-heap is a complete binary tree
  -  The value of each node is less than or equal to the value of its children
  -  The time complexity of heap push/pop is $O(log n)$

Accessing elements in a HashMap

```java
for (Map.Entry<String, String> entry : hm.entrySet()) {  // keys and values
  System.out.println  (entry.getKey() + “ “ + entry.getValue());
}
for (String key : hm.keySet()) { System.out.println(key); } // keys
for (String value : hm.values()) { System.out.println(value); } // values
```

## Review Notes

### #1 Sorting . Brute force approach

We use a hashmap data strucutre that we can populate with pairs of numbers and frequencies. after doing that we solved recording the frequency of each number in a linear time and space, next we sort our HashMap by converting it into a ArrayList using `Map.Entry` interface, we do that by sorting the numbers in descending order of their frequencies, when we have the sorted items, we return the first K elements.

1. Using the hashmap we will extract he feeqneuct of each number
   1. [1,1,1,2,2,3] -> {1:3, 2:2, 3:1}
2. Then we'll create a new list where each element is a list of two values frequency and the number.
   1. [[2,2], [1,3], [3,1]]
3. Finally, we'll sort the list based on frequencies.
   1. [[3,1], [2,2], [1,3]]
4. And then get and return the fist `k` values
   1. [1,2]

<br>

- **Time complexity**: $O(N log n)$ 
  - For sorting an array containing all the unique values and their respective frequencies the time complexity is $O(Nlog n)$ 
- **Space**: $O(NK)$ 
  - Space Complexity: 
  - $O(n)$ for creating the hashmap, where n the number of the array length

### #2 Using a Heap . 2nd approach

Based on that: most of times when we want to optimize our solution we start by fixing the most inefficient bottlenecks ad n in brute force case it's the sorting whuch takes $O(n log n)$ time.

So since we only care about the top $k$ mmost frequent elements based on the problem statemenet, It's a good idea to think about using a Heap data structure since we want to keep a track of the highest elements.


we keep our minheap that’s at size k, if its bigger than k pop the min, by the end it should be left with k largest elements;


1. We build a hash map {element : frequency}. which takes $O(N)$ time. $N$ is a number of array items.

2. Then we build a heap of size k using N elements. 
3. To add the first k elements takes a linear time $O(k)$ in the average case, and O(klog k) in the worst case. 
4. After the first k elements we start to push and pop at each step, $N - k$ steps in total, meaning $O((N−k)logk)$ time complexity. 
5. Adding both parts up, we get O(Nlogk) time complexity for the second step.
6. Finally we convert the heap into the `top` output array. which takes $O(klogk)$ time for the pop operations


- **Time complexity**: $O(n log k)$ 
  - $O(N log k)$ if $k$ is smaller than $N$, and $O(n log n)$ if $k = N$.


- **Space Complexity**: $O(N+K)$ 
  - hash map with not more N elements, and a heap with k elements.

### #3 Bucket sort . 3rd approach


We follow the same idea as in the previous approach by adding the elements and their frequencies to the hashmap. 
- THen we create buckets for each element
- We iterate over the keys of the hahmap and insert them into the buckets, e.g. if 4 has frequency 3, we insert 4 into the bucket with index 3.
- and that's it. we have sorted the nunbers by their frequencies
- We iterate over the buckets in the reverse direction and collect the elements
- We iterate over a bucket and empty its element in the flattened list
- We iterate ove the flattened list and store the top k elements in the $top$ array
  
- **Time complexity**: $O(n)$ 

- **Space**: $O(n)$
